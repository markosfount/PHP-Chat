# PHP-Chat
This is an implementation of a simple backend chat, implemented in PHP and SQLite. Asynchonous calls to the server are done with AJAX, using a bit of JQuery. The technique used for getting new messages from the server is the relatively old technique of long polling, where rather than polling the server for new data in standard intervals, establishes a connection to the server and waits until there are new data, or timeouts after a small period of time (20 s). The db tables necessary can be created with the file createdb.php, and a very simple gui and login part are included. The application is run by accessing the file chat.php, after the db has been created.
